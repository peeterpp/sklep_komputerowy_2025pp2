### Lab 10

The aim of the lab is to prepare the environment for creating a full-stack Next.js application, learn the basics of this framework and become familiar with handling routes.

### Lab 11

The goal of this lab is to use advanced page types (including dynamic) in Next.js and apply Tailwind CSS to style the application.

### Lab 12

The goal of this lab is to use Prisma's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a database (in this case, Postgres) as a source of truth for an application created in Next.js.

### Lab 13

The goal of this lab is to implement authentication in the Next.js application using the external Auth.js library. We need to add the ability to log in using a GitHub account and display the contents of their shopping cart to that user.
